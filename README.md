### How to contribute
Selflow is a Monorepo managed with <a href="https://nx.dev/"><img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/N/nx-logo-8EB5A23B44-seeklogo.com.png" height="10"> Nx</a>.
This comes form the will to have the whole project and plugins in a single repository to centralize all decisions and issues and avoid having unmaintained plugins.

__You do not have to have a Node.js environment to contribute__, but this will help you.

#### Setup with NX (optional)
To set up the repository and install NX locally, you will need a

environment and
<a href=""><img height="10" src="https://seeklogo.com/images/Y/yarn-logo-F5E7A65FA2-seeklogo.com.png"> Yarn</a>
installed on your system.

To install Yarn, you can run
```bash
# Might requires sudo privileges, depending on your node installation
npm install -g yarn
```

Then set up the project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/selflow/selflow.git
cd selflow
# Install dependencies
yarn
# Check NX installation
yarn nx graph
```
