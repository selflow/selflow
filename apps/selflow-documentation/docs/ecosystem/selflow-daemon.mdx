title: üê± Selflow-Daemon

## Added features

- GRPC API
- Support for Docker Steps

Selflow-Daemon is, as of today, the primary implementation of Selflow.
It adds capabilities for docker steps and can communicate with a GRPC API.

It runs on port `10011` in a docker container to allows you to remove it easily.
It still needs to access a folder on your machine.
Usually the `/etc/selflow` folder but you can customize it using environment variables

## Requirements

- a machine running Linux or MacOS (It works on windows but is not stable enough for now)
- [docker installed and setup](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Getting started

The easiest way to start the Selflow-Daemon is to use the [CLI](./cli)

```bash
selflow recreate-daemon
```

The Deamon will be running on port 10011 on your system and run logs will be stored in the `/etc/selflow` directory on your system.

## Customisation

You can customize the Selflow Daemon behavior using environment variables that you can directly add to the Selflow CLI
