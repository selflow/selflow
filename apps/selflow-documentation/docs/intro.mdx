## What is Selflow ?

Selflow Is a Workflow Orchestration Framework designed to be self-hosted.

### What is a Workflow ?

A Workflow is composed of a group of steps.
Each step executes in its dedicated environment.
Steps can depend on other steps if needed so that they can be executed after them.
Each step has a state to declare the execution state of a step, for example _RUNNING_, _ERROR_ or _SUCCESS_.

In this documentations, workflows are represented like this :

<WorkflowExample className="excalidraw-svg" />

In this example, we have 3 steps :

- Step 🐈 as status "Success"
- Step 🐕 as status "Running"
- Step 😊 as status "Created"

We also know that Step 😊 depends on the 2 other steps.
Since Step 🐕 is not finished, it won't start and stay in a _Created_ state as long has its requirements are not all in a _Success_ state.

### A workflow orchestration framework

Selflow itself behaves like a go library. It doesn't even know the existence of Docker and does not communicate with the outside world.
It is commonly refers as the **Selflow Core**. It only handles the workflow execution side.

The power of the tool comes from its ecosystem !
