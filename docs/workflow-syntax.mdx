title: ✏️ Workflow Syntax
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The workflow syntax is very simple :

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="Yaml">

```yaml
name: 'Simple case'
description: 'Steps a and b should log their names'
author: 'Selflow Community'

workflow:
  timeout: '5m'
  steps:
    step-a:
      kind: 'docker'
      with:
        image: 'node:lts'
        commands: |
          echo "##step-a##"

    step-b:
      kind: 'docker'
      with:
        image: 'node:lts'
        commands: |
          echo "##step-b##"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="Json">

```json
{
  "name": "Simple case",
  "description": "Steps a and b should log their names",
  "author": "Selflow Community",
  "workflow": {
    "timeout": "5m",
    "steps": {
      "step-a": {
        "kind": "docker",
        "with": {
          "image": "node:lts",
          "commands": "echo \"##step-a##\"\n"
        }
      },
      "step-b": {
        "kind": "docker",
        "with": {
          "image": "node:lts",
          "commands": "echo \"##step-b##\"\n"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Metadata

First, the workflow starts with the metadata attributes :

```yaml
name: 'Simple case'
description: 'Steps a and b should log their names'
author: 'Selflow Community'
```

These fields are ignore by Selflow, you can use them if you want to specify things about your workflow like why you are using them.

In the future, the idea is to be able to access these fields in the steps definitions and to be able to put names on workflow executions.

### The workflow definition

```yaml
workflow:
  timeout: '5m'
  steps:
    step-a:
      kind: 'docker'
      with:
        image: 'node:lts'
        commands: |
          echo "##step-a##"

    step-b:
      kind: 'docker'
      with:
        image: 'node:lts'
        commands: |
          echo "##step-b##"
```

This part contains all the workflow definition.
First, the `timeout` attribute specifies the maximum duration of the workflow, **it is required**.

Then, the `steps` attributes contains a map of all steps.
You can have more details about this part in the [step documentation](./steps)
