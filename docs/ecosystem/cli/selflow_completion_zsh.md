## selflow completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for zsh

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it. You can execute the following once:

    echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

To load completions in your current shell session:

    source <(selflow completion zsh)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

    selflow completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_selflow"

#### macOS:

    selflow completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_selflow

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

```
selflow completion zsh [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --recreate-daemon   Kill and recreate the daemon if it already exists
```
