It can execute workflows by itself or launching them in the background using the [Selflow-Daemon](../selflow-daemon).

:::info
Some Selflow Cli commands depends on the [Selflow-Daemon](../selflow-daemon) if it doesn't run on your system, any
command that requires it will create it for you using Docker.
A Docker environment is also needed.

## Core features

- Run workflows that use local commands
- Start the [Selflow-Daemon](../selflow-daemon) with docker

## Installation

Since Selflow is not ready for production yet, you will need to build the CLI yourself.
**Don't worry**, you only need to have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) setup on your machine in version `1.20` or up and run this command :

```bash
go install github.com/selflow/selflow/apps/selflow-cli@latest
```

The executable will be added into your `$GOBIN` location. Make sure to add it in your `$PATH`.

Check that the executable works with

```bash
selflow-cli help
```
