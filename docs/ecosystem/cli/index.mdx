:::info
Selflow Cli depends on [Selflow-Daemon](../selflow-daemon) if it doesn't run on your system, it will create it for you using Docker.
A Docker environment is also needed.
:::

## Installation

Since Selflow is not ready for production yet, you will need to build the CLI yourself.
**Don't worry**, it only need to have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) setup on your machine in version `1.20` or up and run this command :

```bash
go install github.com/selflow/selflow/apps/selflow-cli
```

The executable will be added into your `$GOBIN` location. Make sure to add it in your `$PATH`.

Check that the executable works with

```
selflow-cli help
```

If the CLI can not reach the Selflow-Daemon, it will create it using Docker.

## Commands

### `recreate-daemon`

#### Usage

```bash
selflow-cli recreate-daemon
```

Kill and start a new [Selflow Daemon](../selflow-daemon)

### `run`

#### Usage

```bash
selflow-cli run ./path/to/your/workflow/file.json
```

Start a run from the workflow of the given file. the file can be in json or yaml format. See Configuration reference for more details.

It currently shows logs in a debug format

### `status`

```bash
selflow-cli status my-run-id
```

Displays the status of each step of a run. The run id can be read from the `run` command logs.
